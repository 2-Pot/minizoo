The project was to create a (fictitious) zoo website including a graphic chart, three categories of service/products, an account system, a database, and that it be sufficiently secure.

So we created the MiniZoo site, the zoo for small animals only. We have implemented a home page, a practical information page, an e-shop page and an account page. We also created a graphic charter with three colors (grey, white and brown) and a logo.
On the homepage, we have added three links to the history, species and reviews pages. On the e-store page, we have added two new pages.
The first is for the sale of entrance tickets to the zoo in which we can choose the price and the number of tickets to buy. 
The second is the gift/goodie shop with a cart that we can fill with items we wishes to purchase.
We have implemented a registration and connection system with an e-mail and a password. The site is responsive.

We have not managed to implement the addition of articles in the basket and the payment management.
We couldn't hash passwords or add a cookie system.
